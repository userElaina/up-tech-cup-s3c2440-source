<LI>GENERAL
<P>The Software is owned by Rogue Wave Software, Inc. ("Rogue Wave") and is protected by U.S. copyright laws and other laws and by international treaties.  It is intended for use by a software programmer who has experience using development tools and class libraries.  The Software is not intended for use by consumers for household use.</P>
<P>This Rogue Wave Single User Software License Agreement ("Agreement") accompanies the Licensed Software.  This copy of the Licensed Software is licensed to you as the end user or to your employer ("Company") for your exclusive use as an end user.  "You" as used in the remainder of this Agreement shall refer to the individual licensee, whether as an individual programmer or as a Company.  If you do not accept this Agreement, you may return this package along with dated proof of purchase to the place you obtained it within thirty (30) days and your money will be refunded, and you will not be licensed to unlock or to use the Software.</P>
<LI>LICENSE GRANTS
<P>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Rogue Wave grants to you the non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-concurrent right to use the Software Application Programming Interface on a single computer by a single individual user, except that this license does not grant you the right to use the Licensed Software on any Mainframe Class Computer.  If multiple copies have been purchased, you may load one copy of the Licensed Software on a server and permit those individuals (who purchased the Licensed Software or for whom the Licensed Software was purchased) to access and execute the Licensed Software.  This is not a concurrent user license; the rights granted are not for any individual(s) up to the number of licenses purchased.  The rights are granted only to the specified individual(s) in your purchase order for whom the Licensed Software was purchased.  You may also:</P>
