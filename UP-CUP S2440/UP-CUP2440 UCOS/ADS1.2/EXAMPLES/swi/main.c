Note:  If you are using a processor with separate instruction and data caches,

do not prevent the new contents of the vectors from being used. 
The data cache (or at least the entries containing the modified vectors) must 
be cleaned to ensure the new vector contents are written to main memory. You 
must then flush the instruction cache to ensure that the new vector contents 
are read from main memory.  For details of cache clean and flush operations, 
see the datasheet for your target processor.
