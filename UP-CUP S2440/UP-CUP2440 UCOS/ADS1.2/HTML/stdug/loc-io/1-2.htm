<H2>1.2 About Locales and Iostreams</H2>
<P>This manual deals with the Standard C++ Library treatment of locales and iostreams. We include these topics in a separate manual for the convenience of developers who would like to use them independently of the full library.</P>
<A NAME="idx1"><!></A>
<P>Both locales and iostreams existed prior to the recent standardization of the C++ language and library. Many developers are already comfortable with using iostreams, and have integrated them into their existing code. They have no reason to associate iostreams with the new standard, and in any case, this new implementation of iostreams is not so very different from the old.</P>
<A NAME="idx2"><!></A>
<P>Locales have been around a long time, too, but they change significantly in the Standard C++ Library. The old locale is part of the C library and consists of a group of C function calls, like <SAMP>setlocale</SAMP>. The new locale performs the same operations, but consists of a set of C++ classes and functions, so the interface is completely changed. Iostreams depend on locales, so they are discussed together in this manual.</P>
