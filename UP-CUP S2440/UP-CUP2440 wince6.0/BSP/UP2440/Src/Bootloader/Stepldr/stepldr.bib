;
; NOTE: The Steppingstone loader can only be 4096 bytes in length max.  Romimage
;       will need to create and page-align the .pdata section and the linker generates 
;       a 1-page header on the file.  In this .bib file we'll call the size 0x3000, 
;       but we'll post-process the .nb0 file to remove the .pdata section and the header.
;
; NOTE: The Steppingstone loader and the IPL are concatenated and stored in the
;       first two SmartMedia NAND flash blocks.  If the size of either loader is
;       altered in the .bib file, the bootloader code will need to be updated as
;       it makes an assumption about the first two NAND flash blocks being reserved.
