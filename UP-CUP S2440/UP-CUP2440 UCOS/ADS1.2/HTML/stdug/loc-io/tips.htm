<h3><a name="ug">User's guide navigation features</a></h3>
<p>
The user's guides (also build guides, platform guides, and installation guides) have these navigation features:
<ul>
<li>A chapter-name table of contents on the opening page, providing links to the manual's major topics.
<li>A section-name table of contents at the beginning of each chapter, providing links to the chapter's detailed topics.
<li>A comprehensive table of contents in case you want to see everything. The <b>Contents</b> button leads here.
<li>Usually, a topic index based on the index markup in the print document. The links are based on the name of the section to which the link leads to assist you in deciding which link to follow.
</ul>


<h3><a name="ref">Reference guide navigation features</a></h3>
<p>
The reference guides have these navigation features:
<ul>
<li>Links to the major sections on the opening page, with the final link being to the section of class descriptions.
<li>A hypertext list of class descriptions. The <b>Contents</b> button leads here.
<li>A section-name table of contents at the beginning of each class description, providing links to the categories of descriptions.
<li>A per-class method/data type hypertext index at the beginning of each class description.
<li>A comprehensive hypertext index of methods and data types. The links are based on the name of the class description to which the link leads, so for methods or data types that appear in multiple classes you can easily select the link to class in which you are interested.
</ul>
