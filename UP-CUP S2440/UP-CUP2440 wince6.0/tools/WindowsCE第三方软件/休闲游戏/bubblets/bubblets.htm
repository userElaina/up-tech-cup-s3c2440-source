<p>
Bubblets is easy to learn, yet difficult to master.  The objective is
to align similar bubbles in order to form large blocks of bubbles
before bursting them.  The more bubbles in the block before they
are bursted, the greater number of points you will receive.
</p>
<p>
In order to burst a bubble, the bubble must be connected
to other similar bubbles on the playing board.  If you tap a bubble
that is connected, those connected bubbles will be highlighted and a
new bubble will pop up, displaying that block's potential bubble points.
Tap on your selection again in order to burst the bubbles.  All bubbles
above your bursted block will now fall down.
<p>
Bubble Bonus
</p>
<p>
If you manage to leave fewer than 5 unbursted bubbles on
the board you will be rewarded with more points at the conclusion of
the game.

<li>Standard - the default mode of play where there is a set number of
  bubbles that will not increase
<li>Continuous - in this style, whenever a vertical set of bubbles has been
  bursted and the remaining bubbles have shifted over to the right, a new
  randomly selected column of bubbles will pop up on the left, thereby
  allowing a game to be played for an extended amount of time
<li>Shifter - in this style, when a set of bubbles has been bursted, all
  remaining bubbles to the top and left will shift down and to the
  right
<li>MegaShift - this style is a combination of the shifter and
  continuous styles in that bubbles will shift down and to the right
  while empty columns will fill on the left
</ul>
