<H2>13.3 Searching Operations</H2>
<A NAME="idx271"><!></A>
<P>The next category of algorithms we describe are used to locate elements within a sequence that satisfy certain properties. Most commonly the result of a search is then used as an argument to a further operation, such as a <SAMP>copy</SAMP> (<A HREF="13-2.htm#1322">Section 13.2.2</A>), a <SAMP>partition</SAMP> (<A HREF="13-4.htm#1344">Section 13.4.4</A>), or an <SAMP>in-place merge</SAMP> (<A HREF="13-4.htm#1346">Section 13.4.6</A>.)</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><HR>
<B>NOTE: The example functions described in the following sections are in the file alg2.cpp.
</B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The searching routines described in this section return an iterator that identifies the first element that satisfies the search condition. It is common to store this value in an <B><I><A HREF="../../stdref/ite_5554.htm">iterator</A></I></B> variable, as follows:</P>
<UL>
<PRE>
list&lt;int&gt;::iterator where;
where = find(aList.begin(), aList.end(), 7);</PRE>
</UL>
<P>If you want to locate <I>all</I> the elements that satisfy the search conditions, you must write a loop. In that loop, the value yielded by a previous search is first advanced, since otherwise the value yielded by the previous search would once again be returned. The resulting value is then used as a starting point for the new search.   For example, the following loop from the <SAMP>adjacent_find()</SAMP> example program (<A HREF="13-3.htm#1332">Section 13.3.2</A>) will print the value of all repeated characters in a string argument:</P>
<UL>
<PRE>while ((where = adjacent_find(where, stop)) != stop) {
   cout &lt;&lt; "double " &lt;&lt; *where &lt;&lt; " in position " 
      &lt;&lt; where - start &lt;&lt; endl;
   ++where;
   }</PRE>
</UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE><HR>
<B>NOTE: The searching algorithms in the Standard C++ Library all return the end-of-sequence iterator if no value is found that matches the search condition. As it is generally illegal to dereference the end-of-sequence value, it is important to check for this condition before proceeding to use the result of a search.
</B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Many of the searching algorithms have an optional argument that can specify a function for comparing elements in place of the equality operator <SAMP>==</SAMP> for the container element type. In the descriptions of the algorithms, we write these optional arguments inside a square bracket to indicate they need not be specified if the standard equality operator is acceptable.</P>

<A NAME="1331"><H3>13.3.1 Find an Element Satisfying a Condition</H3></A>
<A NAME="idx272"><!></A>
<P>There are two algorithms, <SAMP>find()</SAMP> and <SAMP>find_if()</SAMP>, that are used to find the first element that satisfies a condition. The declarations of these two algorithms are as follows:</P>
<UL>
<PRE>
InputIterator find_if (InputIterator first, InputIterator last, 
      Predicate);

InputIterator find (InputIterator first, InputIterator last, 
      const T&amp;);</PRE>
</UL>
<P>The algorithm <SAMP>find_if()</SAMP> takes as argument a predicate function, which can be any function that returns a boolean value (see <A HREF="3-2.htm">Section 3.2</A>). The <SAMP>find_if()</SAMP> algorithm returns a new <B><I><A HREF="../../stdref/ite_5554.htm">iterator</A></I></B> that designates the first element in the sequence that satisfies the predicate. The second argument, the past-the-end iterator, is returned if no element is found that matches the requirement. Because the resulting value is an <B><I>iterator</I></B>, the dereference operator <SAMP>*</SAMP> must be used to obtain the matching value. This is illustrated in the example program.</P>
<P>The second form of the algorithm, <SAMP>find()</SAMP>, replaces the predicate function with a specific value, and returns the first element in the sequence that tests equal to this value, using the appropriate equality operator <SAMP>==</SAMP> for the given datatype.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><HR>
<B>NOTE: The algorithms find() and find_if() perform a linear sequential search through the associated structures. The set and map data structures, which are ordered, provide their own find() member functions, which are more efficient. Because of this, the generic find() algorithm should not be used with set and map.
</B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The following example program illustrates the use of <SAMP>find()</SAMP> and <SAMP>find_if()</SAMP>:</P>

<A NAME="1332"><H3>13.3.2 Find Consecutive Duplicate Elements</H3></A>
<A NAME="idx274"><!></A>
<P>The <SAMP>adjacent_find()</SAMP> algorithm is used to discover the first element in a sequence equal to the next immediately following element. For example, if a sequence contained the values <SAMP>1 4 2 5 6 6 7 5</SAMP>, the algorithm would return an <B><I><A HREF="../../stdref/ite_5554.htm">iterator</A></I></B> corresponding to the first <SAMP>6</SAMP> value. If no value satisfying the condition is found, then the end-of-sequence iterator is returned. The declaration of the algorithm is as follows:</P>
<UL>
<PRE>
ForwardIterator adjacent_find (ForwardIterator first, 
   ForwardIterator last [, BinaryPredicate ] );</PRE>
</UL>
<P>The first two arguments specify the sequence to be examined. The optional third argument must be a <I>binary predicate</I>, a binary function returning a boolean value. If present, the binary function is used to test adjacent elements, otherwise the equality operator <SAMP>==</SAMP> is used.</P>
<P>The example program searches a text string for adjacent letters. In the example text these are found in positions <SAMP>5</SAMP>, <SAMP>7</SAMP>, <SAMP>9</SAMP>, <SAMP>21</SAMP>, and <SAMP>37</SAMP>. The increment is necessary inside the loop in order to avoid the same position being discovered repeatedly.</P>

If no match is found, the second argument is returned. Because the resulting value is an <B><I>iterator</I></B>, the dereference operator <SAMP>*</SAMP> must be used to obtain the matching value.

<P>The functions <SAMP>max()</SAMP> and <SAMP>min()</SAMP> can be used to find the maximum and minimum of a pair of values.

<A NAME="1337"><H3>13.3.7 Locate the First Mismatched Elements in Parallel Sequences</H3></A>
<A NAME="idx285"><!></A>
<P>The name <SAMP>mismatch()</SAMP> might lead you to think this algorithm is the inverse of the <SAMP>equal()</SAMP> algorithm, which determines if two sequences are equal (<A HREF="13-6.htm#1364">Section 13.6.4</A>). Instead, the <SAMP>mismatch()</SAMP> algorithm returns a <B><I><A HREF="../../stdref/pai_5818.htm">pair</A></I></B> of iterators that together indicate the first positions where two parallel sequences have differing elements. The structure <B><I>pair</I></B> is described in <A HREF="9-1.htm">Section 9.1</A> and <A HREF="9-2.htm#921">Section 9.2.1</A>. </P>
<P>The second sequence is denoted only by a starting position, without an ending position. It is assumed, but not checked, that the second sequence contains at least as many elements as the first. The arguments and return type for <SAMP>mismatch()</SAMP> can be described as follows:</P>
<UL>
<PRE>
pair&lt;InputIterator, InputIterator&gt; mismatch 
   (InputIterator first1, InputIterator last1, 
      InputIterator first2 [, BinaryPredicate ] );</PRE>
</UL>
<P>The elements of the two sequences are examined in parallel, element by element. When a mismatch is found, that is, a point where the two sequences differ, then a <B><I><A HREF="../../stdref/pai_5818.htm">pair</A></I></B> containing <B><I><A HREF="../../stdref/ite_5554.htm">iterator</A></I></B>s denoting the locations of the two differing elements is constructed and returned. If the first sequence is exhausted before discovering any mismatched elements, then the resulting <B><I>pair</I></B> contains the ending value for the first sequence, and the last value examined in the second sequence. The second sequence need not yet be exhausted.</P>
<P>The example program illustrates the use of this procedure. The function <SAMP>mismatch_test()</SAMP> takes as arguments two <B><I><A HREF="../../stdref/str_8586.htm">string</A></I></B> values. These are lexicographically compared and a message printed indicating their relative ordering. This is similar to the analysis performed by the <SAMP>lexicographic_compare()</SAMP> algorithm, although that function simply returns a boolean value. </P>
<P>Because the <SAMP>mismatch()</SAMP> algorithm assumes the second sequence is at least as long as the first, a comparison of the two string lengths is performed first, and the arguments are reversed if the second string is shorter than the first. After the call on <SAMP>mismatch()</SAMP>, the elements of the resulting <B><I><A HREF="../../stdref/pai_5818.htm">pair</A></I></B> are separated into their component parts. These parts are then tested to determine the appropriate ordering.</P>
